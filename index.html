  <h1>ITMD-541, Web Application Development Introduction</h1>
  <h2>About the class</h2>
  <p>On a basic note, this course will further enhance the fundementals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript we've learned previously in a different class. I hope to take these lessons to heart and use them in a job scenario!</p>
  <h2>About myself</h2>
  <p>My name is Philip Le, I don't really go by anything else, and I don't mind other names also. At the moment, I'm in my 4th year and I'm doing Co-Terminal this semester including this class! When it comes to experience, I really only have last years web development class as experience so I'm not and expert by any means, but I'm still in an eager leaning phase!</p>
  <h3>Other things about me</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I am currently an ITM Major with a specialization in Web Design.</li>
    <li>I'm apart of the Volleyball Club for a year now and would love if other people would join as well!</li>
    <li>In free time, I'm usually messing around with games, Photoshop, and Premier Pro (although I'm just an amateur).</li>
    <li>I'm a bit of a Tetris enthusiast.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>I'm not too much of a person to talk about goals, but I wanted to layout to path for myself. Taking this class, I hope that I can learn skills and use it for a future job/intern, and as well as personal use. I imagine that I can definitely use this in many ways such as creating websites for myself like a portfollio, or making it for someone else. Apart from this class, I hope I can work on design projects with Photoshop and what not. </p>

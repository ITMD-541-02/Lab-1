  <h1>ITMD-541, Web Application Development Introduction</h1>
  <h2>About the class</h2>
  <p>On a basic note, this course will further enhance the fundementals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript we've learned previously in a different class. I hope to take these lessons to heart and use them in a job scenario!</p>
